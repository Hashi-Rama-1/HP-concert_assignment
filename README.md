# A concert ticket booking system using pthreads
A concert ticket booking system receives booking requests from multiple customers. In the real world scenario, if we don’t handle requests efficiently, the system might crash or slow down due to overwhelming demand. 

You will simulate the concert ticket booking system using multiple customer requests and multiple booking agents (pthreads) running in parallel.
- Customers request a certain number of tickets
- Booking agents (threads) allocate tickets based on availability
- The total ticket count must stay consistent and be synchronized across the booking agents
- You must queue the customer requests in a queue, whose size is limited by the constant MAX_BUFFER_SIZE (set to 5)
- If 0 < `number of tickets remaining` < `number of tickets requested by a customer`, the customer is given `number of tickets remaining` tickets
- If the tickets are exhausted (`number of tickets remaining` = 0), all the customers after that will be allotted 0 tickets

A serial implementation of the system is provided in `concert_serial.cpp`. Your job is to parallelize this and write it in another file `concert_parallel.cpp`. Feel free to write the parallel code from scratch too!

This assignment will be manually evaluated. Grading will be transparent and any loss of marks will be explained.

## Input format
The input has the first line as the total tickets available for the show. Followed by this will be `n` lines with the format <customer_name><space><no_of_tickets_requested>

A sample input is
```
10
A 4 
B 2 
C 1
D 2
```

## Output format
The output format is a bunch of print statements for each customer, and after all customer requests are handled, the number of tickets remaining is printed.
```
Customer <name> requested <number_of_tickets_requested> tickets
Customer <name> given <number_of_tickets_allotted> tickets
...
Remaining tickets: <number_of_tickets_remaining>
```

Example output for the above sample input:
```
Customer 1 requested 4 tickets
Customer 2 requested 2 tickets
Customer 1 given 4 tickets
Customer 3 requested 1 tickets
Customer 2 given 2 tickets
Customer 3 given 1 tickets
Customer 4 requested 2 tickets
Customer 4 given 2 tickets
Remaining tickets: 1
```
